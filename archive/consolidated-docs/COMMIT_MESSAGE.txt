feat: Add real swarm execution with Claude API integration

- Fix basicSwarmNew undefined error that crashed the CLI
- Implement real Claude API execution replacing mock implementations
- Add headless/remote execution support for Docker/CI environments
- Enable graceful shutdown preventing hanging processes
- Add comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

Key features:
- Multi-agent orchestration with specialized AI personalities
- Intelligent task decomposition and parallel execution
- Cost tracking and token usage monitoring
- Structured output generation with synthesis
- Support for multiple execution strategies (development, research, analysis)

Implementation:
- Created ExecutionBridge to route between execution modes
- Added ClaudeAPIExecutor for real API calls
- Implemented RealSwarmExecutor for multi-agent orchestration
- Added graceful shutdown handler for clean process termination
- Created comprehensive test suite and documentation

Tested with real API producing actual AI-generated outputs:
- Simple tasks: ~30s, 2-3k tokens
- Complex research: ~70s, 5-6k tokens

Breaking changes: None - uses --executor flag to opt into real execution
